**Describe the feature or change you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to be added.

 - For changes to the PDF: what's the content and (roughly) how do you want it formatted?
 - For changes in protocol: a description of what's different and how it changes the results is helpful to get started. Example files are great!

**Timeline**
Would this be nice to have, is it on the horizon, or is it urgently necessary? If it's urgent definitely mention it in Slack (but having an issue is still useful).

**Additional context**
Add any other context that might be useful. If there are other people (besides you) to ask for details, list them here.
